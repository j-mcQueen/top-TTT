## TIC TAC TOE

A simple game of tic-tac-toe where one player controls both X and O. This project was developed as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course - check out my [live version]()

## new things I've learned

- Experience using the Revealing Module Pattern for functions which are only needed once (game board, DOM element storage, display control, etc.), and how to use the pattern to remove global scope pollution
- Experience using factory functions for when I need to use something multiple times (players)
- Making use of toggleAttribute() more to use less of setAttribute() to apply inline styles
- Understanding how to use pseudocode a little more effectively when problem solving
- The importance of code documentation through comments!
- Developed understanding of scope and the concepts of closure & namespacing

## biggest challenges

- Detecting a win or tie condition
- How to effectively problem solve at every stage (understanding the problem and explaining it in plain English, pseudocoding the problem then breaking the problem up into parts and implementing each small part)

## technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## known bugs/ areas for improvement
